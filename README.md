# Otaku-Read

Check out my latest project, "Otaku Read"! I developed a robust e-commerce platform using Servlets, JSP, and MySQL that showcases my full-stack development expertise. With both administrative and user functionalities, the platform offers an efficient and user-friendly shopping experience. The administrative panel allows for easy management of product listings.

The administrative panel allows administrators to efficiently manage product listings. Admins can add new products, edit existing ones, and update availability, ensuring the platform remains up-to-date with the latest inventory.

On the user side, I prioritized an intuitive and user-friendly shopping experience. Users can browse a wide range of books, easily add items to their carts, and simulate the purchase process.
